# streamhelper - osu.nzxl.space

StreamHelper is a free to use, powerful and simple *beatmap request* bot for osu! players.  
The main purpose of this service is just to make every streamers life easier. It's only 3 clicks away, what are you waiting for?


# Registration
**Heads Up!** For this service you need to have a working *Discord Presence* and a linked *Twitch account* to your *Discord*.  

Why is this needed you ask?  
The bot heavely depends on *Discord* data, mainly so that you don't need to download any other third party software.  

After checking that you have both a working *Discord Presence* and a linked *Twitch account*, all you need to is head over to [osu.nzxl.space](https://osu.nzxl.space) and follow the steps on screen.
