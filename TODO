- Key Overlay
- Score Farm Overlay
- UR Overlay
- PP Overlay
- PP Calculation added - now I need to find a way to integrate scoreStats like acc, hits, misses, combo etc.
- Twitch request bot - add more info to request and !np command
- Add o!rdr support ? ?
- Spectate bot / retrieve replay / check currently playing map with osu! api
- Discord bot to check currently playing - needs id now, maybe create func to search map by name
- Rewrite local-client-app code because it sucks right now.
- Create web page with osu! login with user settings for basically everything (custom overlays, check current status of bot, etc.)
