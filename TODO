- Key Overlay, Score Farm Overlay, UR Overlay, PP Overlay (kinda done)
- Add o!rdr support ? ?
- Spectate bot / retrieve replay / check currently playing map with osu! api
- Website created, now it needs the bot settings and ooc collab!!
- can't open website if not verified on client side (need to fix asap)
- config stuff
- can't use discord activity for np when user is in a multi lobby
- redo the client socket stuff, because it's very weird at this moment:
    one way to do it: save socket id with username and secret -> if user uses overlay or opens the dashboard just emit to username (it should emit to one or more sockets by that without issues)
- beatmap request only accepts 1 mod for now (fuck regex literally)
- bot doesn't leave channel when channel goes offline (opps)
- access tokens invalidate after 24 hours
- verify tokens can't expire, maybe add a 5 mins window to verify or else dismiss
- refactor code it's a fucking mess
- move server backend to c#
- replace console app with a winforms/electron browser that uses https://osu.nzxl.space/
